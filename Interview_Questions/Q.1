/*Write a c code to find the no.of 0's and 1's in a user input value*/

C Program: Count 0's and 1's in a binary representation:

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    unsigned int n;
    int ones = 0, zeros = 0;
    int totalBits = sizeof(n) *8; //number of bits in unsigned int

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%u", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i<totalBits; i++) {
        if (n & (1<<i))
        ones++;
        else
        zeros++;
    }
    printf("Number of 1's = %d\n", ones);
    printf("Number of 0's = %d\n", zeros);
    return 0;
}
